This folder contains Matlab functions to access data from OCT files that are 
acquired using ThorImage OCT 4.x and 5.x. Examples usage is shown in the script file test.m.

In order to run the test file test.m one has to acquire a dataset with ThorImageOCT and store both 
the processed and the spectral raw data (see Settings -> Storage format).

Each of the Matlab functions has help documentation that can be accessed using 'help( function_name )'

This Matlab package has been tested with version R2017a and may not work properly on earlier Matlab versions.
